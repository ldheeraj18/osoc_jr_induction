Merge conflict Resolving

I created a merge conflict in the following manner:
  i) Created two branches - TempA and TempB.
 ii) Modified the GitCommands.txt file in both branches and then added and committed them to the respective branches.
iii) Merged TempA with commandDesc branch, which worked fine.
 iv) Tried to merge TempB with commandDesc branch, which resulted in the merge conflict error.
  v) Used git status command and it said the error was because - both modified GitCommands.txt file.

To resolve this conflict, I followed these steps:
  i) Opened up the file with Vim editor.
 ii) Removed the conflict markers and correctly edited the conflicting line.
iii) Added and commited in the commandDesc branch.
 iv) Finally merged commandDesc with main.
  v) Deleted TempA and Temp B.
